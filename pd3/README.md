# PAYDAY 3 Game Tweaks

## 1. Add -dx12 and -fileopenlog to launch options

1. Open steam
2. Go to your Library at the top
3. Find PAYDAY 3
4. Right click it in the list
5. Select properties
6. Add `-dx12` and `-fileopenlog` to your launch options.

- `-dx12` will improve performance on modern cards that natively support it. You will likely experience stutters while it does some first-time shader calculations, this should go away after you've done a heist or two.
- `-fileopenlog` enables mod support.

## 2. Install mods

1. Head to `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\PAYDAY3\PAYDAY3\Content\Paks`
2. Create a folder called `~mods`
3. Add the .pak files from the [pd3](https://github.com/bigfinfrank/gametweaks/blob/main/pd3) folder in this repository.
