# Steam Client Tweaks

These are tweaks for the steam client itself, not any specific game, but they all affect your Steam games/your general interaction with Steam.

## 1. Launch Options

Replace the target in all `Steam.lnk`s (shortcuts) with the following:

```cmd
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steam.exe" -console -dev -fulldesktopres -offlinemode --showallbetas -silent -testbutton
```

Most of these are self explanatory, but you can see xPaw's dump of steam commands [here](https://gist.github.com/xPaw/fe7d275d31da14d70481) which includes some more info.

## 2. œÄüêÄ

I have multiple accounts. I have family sharing on between those accounts. Some games *cough black ops 3 cough* will not allow me to use the DLCs owned by the primary account, despite already being downloaded and being able to play the normal game.

## 3. Adding all free DLCs for your owned games to your account

1. This will make your game installs take up more storage and your downloads take longer. I have 4TB of NVMe drives and 8gig symmetrical internet, so I don't care, but you might.

2. Go to https://steamdb.info/freepackages/?no_filters=1 and follow the instructions in the "How to use this?" section.

4. Next to "If you want to only view content for your owned games", click "click here to only show these".

5. Click "Activate these packages now" and leave the browser tab open for a few hours, you'll only be able to activate 30 per 90 minutes (1 per 3 minutes).

## 4. Cheaper steam games **(not just with Steam Keys)**

Obviously you can check third party grey-market sites like G2A for Steam keys when buying your games, however there's a 'better' way.

This is called region hopping. Basically, you change your region on Steam to one where the currency's region has a lower median income, meaning games are sold cheaper there so publishers can still make sales and games aren't purely pirated. **It is against Steam ToS** and might be considered tax evasion in certain jurisdictions since you will be charged taxes based on your Steam region, not your actual location, but realistically Steam doesn't enforce it past prevention (making it harder for you to region hop) and your government likely wouldn't find out and if they did, because of how significantly cheaper (typically 50-95%) games are, even on a [$1000 bundle](https://steamdb.info/bundle/6465) you'll only owe them tax on your small ~$50 purchase (not the normal price) which is only a few bucks in tax owed. You can pay them what you owe. You can probably also just declare the extra expenses with your taxes and pay the tax that way manually to keep it above board, but I have no tax, financial, nor legal background so I hold zero responsibility if you get in trouble, check with local professionals first if you're concerned about the consequences.

I have a secreted gist with instructions on how to make a fresh account with the region locked, but the concept is very similar for changing the region of your primary account if you don't want to mess around with family sharing. You can find the gist [here](https://gist.github.com/bigfinfrank/363d5730f52f5f7483c1774ffdeb5742), for changing the region you'll need to do step 2 and then steps 8 onward, the rest of the steps only really apply if you're starting from a fresh account.

## 5. Steam Account security & Safety

I have a gist on this topic as well, it's fairly all-encompassing and you can find it [here](https://gist.github.com/bigfinfrank/a044627149d24b774dfc5bd92b4a4cf8).
