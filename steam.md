# Steam Client Tweaks

## 1. Launch Options

Replace the target in all `Steam.lnk`s (shortcuts) with the following:

```cmd
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steam.exe" -console --debugbutton -dev -fulldesktopres -offlinemode --showallbetas -silent -testbutton
```

These are all mostly self explanatory, but you can see xPaw (the SteamDB Creator)'s dump of steam commands [here](https://gist.github.com/xPaw/fe7d275d31da14d70481) which includes some more info.

## 2. œÄüêÄ

I have multiple accounts. I have family sharing on between those accounts. Some games *cough black ops 3 cough* will not allow me to use the DLCs owned by the primary account, despite already being downloaded and being able to play the normal game.
